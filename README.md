# OCOK: OpenCart OK commandline utility

## Installation

OCOK can be installed globally via composer

    composer global require beyondit/ocok
        
Make sure to place the `~/.composer/vendor/bin directory` in your `PATH` (or `C:\%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin` if working with Windows) so the `ocok` executable is found when you run the `ocok` command in your terminal.
